# Scyta - Intelligent Multi-Agent File Processing System

Scyta is a multi-agent file-system agent that leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and specialized agents to provide intelligent file processing and information retrieval capabilities. The system combines file management, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and external service integrations to deliver a comprehensive solution for personal file management and information access.

## Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent is designed for specific tasks (file operations, RAG, internet access)
- **Chain-of-Thought Processing**: Agents use structured reasoning to break down complex tasks
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different aspects of a task
- **Dynamic Learning**: Agents improve their performance through interaction history and feedback
  
## Core Components

### File Agent
